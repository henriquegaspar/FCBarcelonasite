Media outlet Sport have reported that FC Barcelona stepped up their interest in Héctor Bellerín over the past week. With the UEFA Champions League Last-16 matches against Arsenal, the rumors linking Bellerín with a return to the club whose academy he joined as an 8-year-old were bound to resurface.
</p>
<p>
After the win against Arsenal, Barça first-teamers Gerard Piqué and Andrés Iniesta were reported to have spoken to Bellerín to congratulate him on his impressive performance in the game. The young fullback did largely hold his own against Neymar and certainly did not do a disservice to his chances of a potential return to Camp Nou in the future.
</p>
<p>
According to Sport, one of the topics of conversation between the La Masia-produced trio was an inquiry into his "personal situation" at Arsenal. Since his breakthrough last season, Bellerín has seen off the competition from French international Mathieu Debuchy, who now finds himself on loan at Bordeaux. His "personal situation" certainly seems to be going as well as it could be, with the 20-year-old Spaniard being one of the best fullbacks in the English Premier League this season.
</p>
<p>
A return could very well be on the cards in the near future, when Dani Alves does leave Barça. Bellerín and Aleix Vidal competing for the starting spot at right-back would be great to have. What we do know, however, is to be prepared for a drawn-out saga if/when Barça make a move to bring Bellerín back to Camp Nou.</p>
