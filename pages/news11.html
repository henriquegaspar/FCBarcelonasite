Even though Barcelona players and coaches are focused on the final stretch of the season, club directors are already planning the squad for the next campaign. And one of the new signings could be a big one.
</p>
<p>
According to German outlet Bild, the Blaugrana could be looking at the possibility of making an offer to sign Bayern Munich star David Alaba, who has been heavily linked with a move away from the Bavarians at the end of this season. Alaba is rumored to follow Pep Guardiola and join Manchester City to play in the Premier League, but Barça could enter the race and try to snatch the player.
</p>
<p>
The 23-year-old Austrian international is one of the most versatile and complete players in football. Under Guardiola, Alaba has played virtually every position on the pitch, and although his main position is left-back, he has blossomed into a great central defender and midfielder, and can also play further up the pitch as a winger if need be.
</p>
<p>
His three seasons with Guardiola certainly prepared Alaba to play a Barça style of football, and his passing ability combined with his speed and defensive skills make him a perfect addition to the Catalan giants. Even though Jordi Alba is a world-class full-back, it wouldn't hurt to add a player like Alaba, especially with a rotation-happy coach like Luis Enrique.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I don't think there is any truth to it, but the mere mention of the rumor got me excited. I am a giant Alaba fan, and he'd be just simply perfect. He's as good going forward as he is going back, he's got the speed and the passing ability. Another Alba, basically. And his name is Alaba, which is awesome too.</p>
