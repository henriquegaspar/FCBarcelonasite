<p>
The soap opera is over. Neymar is staying.
</p>
<p>
According to reports from Spain, the Brazilian superstar has agreed to a two-year extension of his current Barcelona contract, that will keep him at the club until 2020. Along with the extra years, Neymar's new deal gives him a huge raise, making the striker one of the highest paid footballers on the planet, just below Lionel Messi.
</p>
<p>
While the player and the club have already reached an agreement, the deal cannot be made official until the summer. But as soon as the new transfer window is open, Neymar will sign his extension and formally announce his decision to remain a Blaugrana.
</p>
<p>
This news will certainly please Barça fans, coaches and board members. Neymar had been strongly linked with moves away from Catalonia, with Manchester United and Manchester City looking like real suitors. The Red Devils, in fact, officially presented a €150 million offer for Neymar's signing, according to the player's father, but it was instantly rejected due to his willingness to stay in Spain.
</p>
<p>
Even better: Spanish media also reported that Neymar bought a new house in Castelldefels, where his 'MSN' partners live. Messi, Suárez and Neymar are now neighbors, best friends and will play together for a long time.
</p>
<p>
It's good to be a Barça fan these days.</p>
