<p>
Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano took the positives from his ban for five yellow cards on Sunday against Eibar as “it’ll be good to get some rest”.
</p>
<p>
Mascherano’s switch from central defence to midfield in the second half, triggered by Sergio Busquets’ substitution, was quickly followed by a booking, which rules him out of Barca’s next La Liga game against Getafe, but he believes he will benefit from the timeout.
</p>
<p>
“Our motivation is to continue leading the table with the advantage that we’ve created until the end of the season,” he said after the game.
</p>
<p>
“That’s what will allow us to reach the end of the season with chances [of success].
</p>
<p>
“Still, much of the season remains and any failure [on our part] gives our rivals an opportunity.
</p>
<p>
“We’re trying to win the League, we’ve opened up a good advantage and we’re trying to maintain it.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want to make mistakes that [our rivals] can take advantage of. All of our upcoming opponents have something at stake.
</p>
<p>
“In football, performances alone don’t give you victories. It’s a very fine line, but playing like we are at the moment puts us closer to glory.
</p>
<p>
“[On his booking], it was a two-on-one and I needed to stop the counterattack.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t seek the card because someone told me to, but it’ll be good to get some rest.
