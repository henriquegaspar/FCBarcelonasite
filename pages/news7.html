<p>It is undeniable that Barcelona continue to look for a fourth attacking player to serve as a quality backup to the 'MSN' trio. And the Blaugrana could be ready to sign a Premier League sensation.
</p>
<p>
According to an "exclusive" report from the Daily Mirror, the Catalan giants are set to make a summer offer to Leicester City for Premier League sensation Riyad Mahrez, one of the best players in England this season. Mahrez has formed a fantastic duo with league's top scorer Jamie Vardy, and both have attracted interest from plenty of European giants.
</p>
<p>
The Foxes, always according to the report, are planning to negotiate a new contract for the Algerian in light of his fantastic season, but because of the growing interest from the Camp Nou giants, the 25-year-old has already made up his mind about a move to Spain as soon as an offer arrives.
</p>
<p>
The Mirror also says the Blaugrana could pay up to â‚¬30 million to secure the player's signing due to the competition from other Premier League teams that also want the talented winger. With great dribbling skills and goal-scoring prowess, Mahrez is argaubly the best player in the league in a season that could see an improbable title candidate walk away with the title, thanks in great part to the Algerian's performances.
</p>
<p>
And if the reports are accurate, he could bring his talents to Catalonia and play for the world's best team.</p>
