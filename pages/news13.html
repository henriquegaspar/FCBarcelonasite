Barcelona midfielder Arda Turan says he is hoping to add to his goalscoring tally with the Catalans after recently breaking his duck.
</p>
<p>
The Turkey international was on target in the thrashing of Rayo Vallecano last week and has taken advantage of a few days off, bestowed on the squad by boss Luis Enrique, to spend time with family and friends in his native country.
</p>
<p>
Speaking at a publicity event, the 29-year-old told of his delight to get off the mark and revealed that he has already given away the shirt he was wearing that evening to Turkish comedian Cem Yilmaz.
</p>
<p>
“I hope there are many more goals to come. The shirt from my first Barcelona goal is in Cem’s hands. He’s like a brother and comes to visit me,” he enthused.
</p>
<p>
The former Atletico Madrid man is not the only player to have jetted off during the midweek break, with Luis Suarez having headed to England, Neymar is in Brazil, and Dani Alves has gone to Italy.</p>
