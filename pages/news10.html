<p>
The rumor mill is insane and will link Barcelona with plenty of players in the next few months. But don't be fooled, the target list is short. Very short.
</p>
<p>
Sources told Barça Blaugranes that Luis Enrique is very satisfied with his current squad. New signings Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal have been great additions and should only get better with more playing time at the club. Sergio Busquets, the best midfielder in football today, wants to renew his contract, and his new deal should be announced sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>
The 'MSN' trio will stay intact for Season Three. Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez have plenty of years left in their contracts, while Neymar Jr., even in the middle of a ridiculous contract negotiation, won't leave the team next year. Rafinha Alcântara should be back from injury soon and reinforce the midfield. Alen Halilovic should return from his good season on loan and start to get opportunities in the first team.
</p>
<p>
No big player sales are expected, but the defense should be changed a little. Marc Bartra and Thomas Vermaelen are not happy with the lack of minutes, and both look set for a move to England in the summer. In the attack, Sandro Ramírez lost the battle to Munir El-Haddadi and will not back up The Three Kings, and could also be headed to the Premier League.
</p>
<p>
Even if those players leave, Enrique is more than happy with his group, but would accept new signings. However, he and his staff have shortlisted only two players to be bought in the summer: Paris Saint-Germain center-back Marquinhos, who is a longtime target of the Blaugrana, and Juventus attacker Paulo Dybala, who has become a world-class player in his short career with the Bianconeri.
</p>
<p>
These two young players with giant potential would be perfect additions to the existing squad, sources say. They're already great players with enough quality to play at the Catalan giants right now, and their age allows them to develop even more and anchor the club once the current stars begin to decline and eventually leave in the future.
</p>
<p>
The only problem with those two is money: both players are expensive and play for clubs who don't let their players go without a big profit in return. We could be looking at a potential €90 million total figure to sign the two, and the club's financial situation does not seem good enough to spend such a huge amount without future implications.
</p>
<p>
However, if the team gets more titles this season, prize money for tournaments and potential player sales would be available in the transfer budget, and that could help sign Dybala and Marquinhos, the guys Lucho wants to make the best team in the world even better.</p>
